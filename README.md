### ABSTRACT:

The goal of this project is to compare different Dimensionality reduction techniques like Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) while performing face recognition using the SVM classifier. The metrics used here are accuracy of the prediction and the training time the classifier needs. This paper also explains the underlying differences in each of the four-dimensionality reduction methods.
